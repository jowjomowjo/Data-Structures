```
P1 focuses on the class C++ construct, including:
* dynamic memory internal to an object
* object state
* public versus private accessibility
* as well as the distinction between a driver and a type definition  
```

## P2
```
P2 focuses on Linked Lists (construction, insertion, deletion, deallocation), dynamic memory 
and pointers as well as C++ timing mechanisms.
```

## P3
```
P3 focuses on Binary Search Trees (BST), recursion and simulation of recursion with a stack data structure.
```

## P4

```

## P5
```
